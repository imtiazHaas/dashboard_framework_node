config/: Contains configuration files for the project. index.js manages project-wide configurations, while dotenv.js handles environment variables.
controllers/: Houses controller files responsible for handling business logic related to API endpoints. For example, apiController.js manages API-related logic, while authController.js handles authentication logic.
models/: Stores model files defining data structures or schemas. For instance, postDataModel.js defines the structure of data objects used in the project.
routes/: Contains route files that define the endpoints and their corresponding controller functions. index.js serves as the main routing file.
test/: Holds test files used for automated testing of the project.

PURPOSE OF FOLDER STRUCTURE

Modularity: The services/ directory further enhances modularity by encapsulating both API-related and authentication-related logic into separate reusable service components (apiService.js and authService.js). This separation promotes maintainability, reusability, and testability throughout the application.
Readability: By organizing files and directories logically, the codebase becomes more readable and understandable for developers joining the project.
Scalability: The structure accommodates future expansion and feature additions, allowing for easy integration of new components without disrupting existing functionality.
